   abstract = {A new framework for sequential multiblock component methods is presented. This framework relies on a new version of regularized generalized canonical correlation analysis (RGCCA) where various scheme functions and shrinkage constants are considered. Two types of between block connections are considered: blocks are either fully connected or connected to the superblock (concatenation of all blocks). The proposed iterative algorithm is monotone convergent and guarantees obtaining at convergence a stationary point of RGCCA. In some cases, the solution of RGCCA is the first eigenvalue/eigenvector of a certain matrix. For the scheme functions x, | x| , x2 or x4 and shrinkage constants 0 or 1, many multiblock component methods are recovered.},

It combines the power of multi-block data analysis methods (maximization of well identified criteria) and the flexibility of PLS path modeling (the researcher decides which blocks are connected and which are not). Searching for a fixed point of the stationary equations related to RGCCA, a new monotonically convergent algorithm, very similar to the PLS algorithm proposed by Herman Wold, is obtained.

   abstract = {There is a growing need to analyze datasets characterized by several sets of variables observed on a single set of observations. Such complex but structured dataset are known as multiblock dataset, and their analysis requires the development of new and flexible tools. For this purpose, Kernel Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (KGCCA) is proposed and offers a general framework for multiblock data analysis taking into account an a priori graph of connections between blocks. It appears that KGCCA subsumes, with a single monotonically convergent algorithm, a remarkably large number of well-known and new methods as particular cases. KGCCA is applied to a simulated 3-block dataset and a real molecular biology dataset that combines Gene Expression data, Comparative Genomic Hybridization data and a qualitative phenotype measured for a set of 53 children with glioma. KGCCA is available on CRAN as part of the RGCCA package.},

   abstract = {Regularized generalized canonical correlation analysis (RGCCA) is a generalization of regularized canonical correlation analysis to 3 or more sets of variables. RGCCA is a component-based approach which aims to study the relationships between several sets of variables. The quality and interpretability of the RGCCA components are likely to be affected by the usefulness and relevance of the variables in each block. Therefore, it is an important issue to identify within each block which subsets of significant variables are active in the relationships between blocks. In this paper, RGCCA is extended to address the issue of variable selection. Specifically, sparse generalized canonical correlation analysis (SGCCA) is proposed to combine RGCCA with an $\ell 1$-penalty in a unified framework. Within this framework, blocks are not necessarily fully connected, which makes SGCCA a flexible method for analyzing a wide variety of practical problems. Finally, the versatility and usefulness of SGCCA are illustrated on a simulated dataset and on a 3-block dataset which combine gene expression, comparative genomic hybridization, and a qualitative phenotype measured on a set of 53 children with glioma.

RGCCA enables deciphering relationships between several sets of variables and subsumes many well-known multivariate analysis methods as special cases. However, RGCCA only deals with vector-valued blocks, disregarding their possible higher-order structures. This paper presents Tensor GCCA (TGCCA), a new method for analyzing higher-order tensors with canonical vectors admitting an orthogonal rank-R CP decomposition. Moreover, two algorithms for TGCCA, based on whether a separable covariance structure is imposed or not, are presented along with convergence guarantees. The efficiency and usefulness of TGCCA are evaluated on simulated and real data and compared favorably to state-of-the-art approaches.},

   abstract = {The growing number of modalities (e.g. multi-omics, imaging and clinical data) characterizing a given disease provides physicians and statisticians with complementary facets reflecting the disease process but emphasizes the need for novel statistical methods of data analysis able to unify these views. Such data sets are indeed intrinsically structured in blocks, where each block represents a set of variables observed on a group of individuals. Therefore, classical statistical tools cannot be applied without altering their organization, with the risk of information loss. Regularized generalized canonical correlation analysis (RGCCA) and its sparse generalized canonical correlation analysis (SGCCA) counterpart are component-based methods for exploratory analyses of data sets structured in blocks of variables. Rather than operating sequentially on parts of the measurements, the RGCCA/SGCCA-based integrative analysis method aims at summarizing the relevant information between and within the blocks. It processes a priori information defining which blocks are supposed to be linked to one another, thus reflecting hypotheses about the biology underlying the data blocks. It also requires the setting of extra parameters that need to be carefully adjusted. Here, we provide practical guidelines for the use of RGCCA/SGCCA. We also illustrate the flexibility and usefulness of RGCCA/SGCCA on a unique cohort of patients with four genetic subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxia, in which we obtained multiple data sets from brain volumetry and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and metabolomic and lipidomic analyses. As a first step toward the extraction of multimodal biomarkers, and through the reduction to a few meaningful components and the visualization of relevant variables, we identified possible markers of disease progression.},
